# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this course I learned about data structures and there pros and cons. We then used this information to make a
reccomendation to ABC University for the data structure needed to sort the courses availiable.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used psuedo code to gather my thoughts on Vectors, Hashtables, and Binary Search Trees. I then determined
the O-Notation based on the psuedo code. With this information and the information provided by ABCU I made 
the recommendation of using a BST to store the courses.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I had a single roadblock for the final project. I was using getline() to read from a csv file and was not parsing
the information correctly. I tried using the 24/7 tutor service to help me work throught the issue but I was not
able to fix the bug. After this I reached out to the professor for help and he confirmed that I was not parsing the
information correctly. With this information I was able to read throught the C++ documentation to find out where I 
made my mistake.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I feel like this project exposed some of my coding weaknesses. So I now have a few areas that I know I need to
improve moving forward. First, my psuedo is a little laxking. I think that I share the gerneral idea but I leave
out some of the steps and it really throws off my work flow. Second, my debuggin skill are lacking. I have very
limited knowledge with the debugger and I would have been able to work through my roadblocks on my own if I was 
more adept with it

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Making sure the programming was adaptable helped me finish 99% of the project quickly. Thorughout the course I had to 
create the functions that I ended up using for the project. Making sure everything was adaptable and readable made 
the project much easier.
